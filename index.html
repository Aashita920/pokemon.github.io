        Pokémon (an abbreviation for Pocket Monsters in Japan) is a Japanese media franchise managed by The Pokémon Company, a company founded by Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. The franchise was created by Satoshi Tajiri in 1996, and is centered on fictional creatures called "Pokémon". In Pokémon, humans, known as Pokémon Trainers, catch and train Pokémon to battle other Pokémon for sport. All media works within the franchise are set in the Pokémon universe. The English slogan for the franchise is "Gotta Catch ‘Em All!". There are currently 913 Pokémon species.
        <br><br>
        Pokémon is set in the fictional Pokemon universe. There are numerous regions that have appeared in the various media of the Pokémon franchise. There are 8 main series regions set in the main series games: Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, Sinnoh/Hisui, Unova, Kalos, Alola, and Galar. Each of the eight generations of the main series releases focuses on a new region. Every region consists of several cities and towns that the player must explore in order to overcome many waiting challenges, such as Gyms, Contests and villainous teams. At different locations within each region, the player can find different types of Pokémon, as well as helpful items and characters. Different regions are not accessible from one another at all within a single game, only with the exception of Kanto and Johto being linked together in Pokémon Gold, Silver, Crystal, HeartGold and SoulSilver versions. There are also regions set in spinoff games and two islands in the Pokémon anime (Orange Islands and Decolore Islands), all still set within the same fictional universe.

        Pokémon also has its own set of weaknesses and strengths. For example, bug-type Pokémon are weak against fire-, flying-, and rock-type moves. Bug-type moves are strong against dark-, grass-, and psychic-type moves. Fire-, flying-, and rock-type moves will do double damage against a bug-type, like Caterpie.
Some Pokémon have two types, which means they can have a doubled weakness or have their strength and weaknesses cancel out to j ust take normal damage. Rayquaza, a dragon- and flying-type, takes four times the damage from ice-type moves. On the flip side, Shuckle, a rock- and bug-type, takes normal damage from fire-type moves, since rock-type is strong against fire-type.
<br><br>
Strengths and weaknesses also aren’t necessarily just opposites of each other. Though fire-type move deal less damage to water-type Pokémon and water-type moves do doubled damage against fire-type Pokémon, this isn’t the case with every type. For example, fighting-type moves are strong against normal-types, but normal-types just do regular damage against fighting-types, rather than do reduced damage.

Knowing what Pokémon’s strengths and weaknesses are is an important aspect of raiding and battling. To do the most damage you can, you should make sure that your Pokémon’s moves are strong against what it’s battling.
